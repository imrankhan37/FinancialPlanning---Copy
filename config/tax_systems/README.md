# Tax System Configurations

This directory contains static tax system configurations that are referenced by scenario files. Tax systems are separated from scenarios because they don't change over time and can be reused across multiple scenarios.

## Structure

Each tax system file follows this structure:

```yaml
tax_system:
  id: "tax_system_id"
  name: "Human Readable Name"
  description: "Detailed description"
  version: "2.0.0"
  created: "2025-01-29"
  currency: "CURRENCY"
  extends: "base_system"  # For US state systems

# Tax-specific configuration
income_tax:  # UK only
  # Tax bands, rates, etc.

national_insurance:  # UK only
  # NI bands and rates

federal:  # US only
  # Federal tax brackets

fica:  # US only
  # Social security and medicare

state:  # US states only
  # State tax configuration

city:  # NYC only
  # City tax configuration

student_loan:  # UK only
  # Student loan repayment configuration (Plan 2)
```

## Benefits of Separation

1. **Reusability**: Same tax system can be used by multiple scenarios
2. **Maintainability**: Tax changes only need to be updated in one place
3. **Cleaner Scenarios**: Focus on location-specific and goal-based parameters
4. **Version Control**: Tax systems can be versioned independently
5. **Professional Standard**: Follows separation of concerns principle
6. **Modularity**: US states extend base federal configuration

## Usage in Scenarios

Scenarios reference tax systems by ID:

```yaml
location:
  name: "United Kingdom"
  currency: "GBP"
  exchange_rate: 1.0
  tax_system: "uk_income_tax_ni"  # References external tax config

location:
  name: "Seattle, WA, USA"
  currency: "USD"
  exchange_rate: 1.26
  tax_system: "us_washington"  # References state-specific config
```

The financial planning system will load the appropriate tax configuration based on this reference.

## Adding New Tax Systems

2. Follow the established structure
3. Include all necessary tax components
4. Update the scenario files to reference the new tax system ID
